- 👋 Hi, I’m @riteshkalbande
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring different options to solve the complexities of a given problem in order to improve our understanding of the same.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep machine learning models (LSTM, CNN, XGBOOST, etc) to implement in atmospheric science field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on atmospheric science problems (pollutants and meteorology) from data science perspective.
- 📫 I can be reached at riteshkalbande@gmail.com.
